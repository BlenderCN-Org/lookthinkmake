This is `inline code`.

This is python block code.

```python
"""
document comment
"""
from urllib.request import urlopen
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#short unnecessry comment
soup = BeautifulSoup(urlopen('http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=78').read())

for row in soup('table', {'class' : 'spad'})[0].tbody('tr'):
  tds = row('td')
  print(tds[0].string, tds[1].string)
  # will print date and sunrise
```
This is an attempt at a python code block with numbers.

	#!/usr/bin/python
	# python code, line numbers and shebang line shown
	print 'Hello world'


And again

~~~~ 
#!/usr/bin/python
# python code, line numbers and shebang line shown
print 'Hello world'
~~~~ 

And again

``` 
#!/usr/bin/python
# python code, line numbers and shebang line shown
print 'Hello world'
```

And some plain text to finish.
