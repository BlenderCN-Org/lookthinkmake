&lt;p&gt;The name of this blog came from a realisation I had growing up. Even when thing were hard, I felt I'd had a good week if I'd done something out of each of the following groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk - met friends, socialised&lt;br /&gt;
Make - created something, writing, sculpture, craft, digital,&lt;br /&gt;
Think - solved something, learnt something&lt;br /&gt;
Look - seen a new movie, play, exhibition, read a book&lt;br /&gt;
Walk - been outdoors, in nature, got some exercise  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these look, think, make, is a good description of the creative process whether its science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look/observe - why is it like that?&lt;br /&gt;
Think/hypothesize - maybe it's because..., if I did this then this should happen&lt;br /&gt;
Make/experiment - well.., that didn't do what I expected but it's interesting, loop back to Look.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or making a dress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look - I like that dress she's wearing, but I'd make the sleeves a bit shorter&lt;br /&gt;
Think - and I can't quite see how they did the crossover top bit, maybe its cut on the diagonal&lt;br /&gt;
Make - this small prototype works, so now I'll make the real dress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find me other places on the web, mostly using the name elfnor.  &lt;/p&gt;
