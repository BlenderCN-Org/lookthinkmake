&lt;p&gt;Its that time of year, in my neighbourhood, where everybody is trying to give away feijoas. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acca_sellowiana"&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/a&gt; fruit also known as pineapple guava or guavasteen have a short shelf life and are not sold in the markets for long or exported.

&lt;p&gt;Its that time of year, in my neighbourhood, where everybody is trying to give away feijoas. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acca_sellowiana"&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/a&gt; fruit also known as pineapple guava or guavasteen have a short shelf life and are not sold in the markets for long or exported. They're one of those great seasonal treats where the first of the season are a delicacy and a week or so later one's looking for recipes to use them in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lacto-fermented pickle (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation"&gt;Lactic acid fermentation - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) like kimchi or sauerkraut and has no added sugar other than that naturally present in the fruit. The pickle (or is it a chutney?) goes great with meat, sausages, or fish. I love it mixed with caramelised onions and served over venison sausages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, some whey drained from live yoghurt can be added to the pickle as a starter, but I've always found the ferment starts on its own from wild bacteria. The salt help select for the right type of bacteria. Once the ferment starts, its pretty good at out-competing any moulds or yeasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fermented-feijoa-pickle"&gt;Fermented Feijoa Pickle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes 4 x 400 ml jars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.5 litres chopped feijoa  ~half with skins ~half scooped&lt;br /&gt;
2 T &lt;a href="http://elfnor.com/fermented-chili-and-garlic-sauce.html"&gt;fermented chili and garlic sauce&lt;/a&gt; - or any chili paste to taste&lt;br /&gt;
2 T black peppercorns&lt;br /&gt;
1 T parsley seed &lt;br /&gt;
1 T black mustard seed&lt;br /&gt;
1 T yellow mustard seed&lt;br /&gt;
1 T klonji seed&lt;br /&gt;
10 kaffir lime leaves&lt;br /&gt;
1 T salt  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spices were an arbitrary combination of what I had available. Feel free to vary, substitute and impersonate, but stick to this amount of salt. I actually used fermented kawakawa berries instead of black peppercorns. The kawakawa berry season finishes long before the feijoa season starts, so I'm probably the only one with both in my garden, and a tendency to experiment with strange ferments. (Don't worry this feijoa pickle is a very successful experiment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find enough glass jars with reasonably wide mouths and another set of small glass jars or tumblers that fit nicely inside the mouth of the larger jars. Clean both jars inside and out. See the &lt;a href="https://www.elfnor.com/preserved-lemons.html"&gt;preserved lemons&lt;/a&gt; post for a diagram of the airlock setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the fruit, cutting any with unblemished skins up whole. Any with less than perfect skins, cut in half and scoop out the insides. Mix in a bowl with everything else. The salt should start to bring out the juice in the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pack the mixture into the jars. When each jar is almost full, push the small jar into the large jar so that the small jar hold the fruit pieces under the juice. The juice should come part way up the outside of the small jar. If necessary, add some weight to the small jar to keep it in place. All this minimizes the surface area exposed to the air and the potential for mould. Put the large jars into a bowl to contain any overflow and cover everything with a plastic bag to keep it all clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave to ferment in a warm place (20 &amp;deg;C to 30 &amp;deg;C) for two or maybe three weeks, the mixture should bubble after the first few days. Any overflow juice can be used in cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2 weeks the fruit should have changed texture and be a lot softer. Put a lid on the large jar and store in the fridge. The pickle should keep for several months at least. Stir occasionally to keep the top layer under the salty juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making &lt;a href="https://www.elfnor.com/preserved-lemons.html"&gt;preserved lemons&lt;/a&gt; I saw a comment somewhere that marmalade was once made by lacto-fermentation rather than with heaps of sugar like jam.

&lt;p&gt;This recipe is tangy and salty and dosen't have the jelly consistency of a cooked marmalade. It's wonderful on sour-dough bread and also makes a great ingredient in a chicken or pork marinade. It can also be used in baking in place of candied/crystallized orange peel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes 1 600 ml jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-2 lemons&lt;br /&gt;
1-2 oranges&lt;br /&gt;
1-2 mandarins&lt;br /&gt;
1-2 t salt  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a ~600 ml glass jar with a wider mouth and another small glass jar that fits neatly inside the mouth of the large jar. Clean both jars inside and out. Find something to weigh down the small jar with. I use glass marbles. See the &lt;a href="https://www.elfnor.com/preserved-lemons.html"&gt;preserved lemons&lt;/a&gt; post for a diagram of the airlock setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut all the citrus fruit into small pieces. Place the chopped fruit into the jar in layers sprinkling some of the salt on each layer and pressing each layer down with a spoon or pestle until the juices run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the jar is almost full push the small jar into the large jar so that all the fruit pieces are held under the juice. The juice should come part way up the outside of the small jar. Add some weight to the small jar to keep it in place. All this minimizes the surface area exposed to the air and the potential for mould.

&lt;p&gt;Leave to ferment in a warm place (20 &amp;deg;C to 30 &amp;deg;C) for about three weeks (many on-line recipes only ferment for a few days but the raw fruit needs a little longer to soften), the mixture should bubble after the first few days. Any overflow juice can be used in cooking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 3 weeks the fruit should have changed texture and be a lot softer. Put a lid on the large jar and store in the fridge. The marmalade should keep for months. Stir occasionally to keep the top layer under the salty juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without my own lemon tree, supermarket lemons are expensive so I go to the Farmers' market and get a large bag and make preserved lemons. When I first made these I didn't realize they were supposed to ferment and was a bit worried by the bubbling. When I use fresh lemons often I use only the juice or the thin outer rind. With the preserved lemons all of the lemon including the white part of the skin gets used. The lemons and juice are a little salty for sweet dishes but are awesome in stir-fries, stews, marinades, dressings, and kale salads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="preserved-lemons"&gt;Preserved Lemons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes 1 600 ml jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-10 lemons&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut the lemons into quarters long ways. Most recipes say to only cut them part way through but they go into the jar better if cut all the way through. Pack into the large jar sprinkling in salt with each layer. Use a spoon or a large pestle to pack the lemons down squeezing out the juice. Continue until the jar is mostly full. The lemon juice should cover the lemon pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push the small jar into the large jar so that all the lemon pieces are held under the juice. The juice should come part way up the outside of the small jar. Add some weight to the small jar to keep it in place. All this minimizes the surface area exposed to the air and the potential for mould.

&lt;p&gt;After 3 weeks the lemon skins should have changed texture and be softer and tastier. Put a lid on the large jar and store in the fridge. The lemons should keep for months. Stir occasionally to keep the lemon pieces under the salty juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many cultures (Louisiana, Thai,  Hunan, Korea, Indonesia, Portugal) make a fermented chili sauce. This is my goto recipe and there's always a jar of this in the fridge. I'm not into fuzzy things like straining it after fermenting preferring the chunky taste surprise. I don't add extra flavorings like ginger or lemon grass as the plain version is more versatile. The fresh red pepper makes sure there are some wild lacto bugs to start the ferment and reduces the heat a little. Feel free to increase the mild pepper to chili ratio for a milder sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of fermenting books and sites suggest you need a special type of salt. I use the table salt I have in the cupboard which is iodized sea salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chili sauce is addictive, before you know it you'll be eating it on toast for breakfast or adding it to chocolate fudge. The fermenting process takes some of the hard edge of the chili flavor while losing none of the heat. I also reckon it reduces after burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fermented-chili-and-garlic-sauce"&gt;Fermented Chili and Garlic sauce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes 1 300 ml jar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200 g frozen red chilies&lt;br /&gt;
3 cloves garlic&lt;br /&gt;
1 large red mild pepper chopped stem removed&lt;br /&gt;
2 t salt  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blend everything and scoop into a clean jar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cover the jar with a  clean cloth and and hold in place with a rubber band.  Leave to ferment in a warm place (20 &amp;deg;C to 30 &amp;deg;C) for at least a week (up to three weeks) - stirring every day - the mixture should bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done stir in 1.5 T of vinegar and keep in fridge. Stir each time you use it. It should last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
